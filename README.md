# Diagram as Code with Python

## Introduction

Creating infrastructure diagrams with code is quite the good idea.

## Review

Some of the benefits I see here are:

1. Easy to debug
2. Easy to share and review
3. Easy to maintain
4. Easy to reuse
5. Easy to deploy to different environments where the output will be used
6. It reduces the mental application of visual design

I do not yet know how far this concept has been used, nor do I know how much it will scale into the future.
However, I think it is a concept that should be taken seriously by Infrastructure engineers and other people who want to improve their infrastructure.

The drawbacks I see for the meantime include:

1. Limitation in components that can be used in diagrams
2. Inability to use custom components or icons in diagrams.
3. Inability to determine to certain properties of the output image such as size or resolution.

## Conclusion

I like the concept of diagram as code, an I encourage others to use it.
